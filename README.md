# Chatbot_NLP


A chatbot is a program that works individually to mimic human communication. The purpose of a chatbot is answer questions and provide comments using artificial intelligence and natural language processing. This allows a form of interaction between human and machine. 

A chatbot is like a normal application. There is an app layer, a database and APIs to call other external administrations. Users can easily access chatbots, it adds intricacy for the application to handle. At the moment, bots are trained according to the past information available to them. 
So, most organizations have a chatbot that maintains logs of discussions. Developers utilize these logs to analyze what clients are trying to ask. 

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is what allows chatbots to understand the messages sent and uses it to respond appropriately. Using NLP,  the chatbot can interpret and act on human language inputs.  


NLP uses five step process:

- Tokenization: The NLP separates a series of words into tokens or pieces that are linguistically representative, with a different value in the application.

- Sentiment Analysis: It will study and learn the user’s experience, and transfer the inquiry to a human when necessary

- Normalization: This program model processes the text to find out the typographical errors and common spelling mistakes that might alter the intended meaning of the user’s request.

- Named Entity Recognition: The program model of chatbot looks for different categories of words, similar to the name of the particular product, the user’s address or name, whichever information is required.

- Dependency Parsing: The Chatbot searches for the subjects, verbs, objects, common phrases and nouns in the user’s text to discover related phrases that what users want to convey.


This chatbot is created using NLP with python in Jupyter. When the user sends a message with “hi”, the NLP lets the chatbot know what that means, giving the chatbot a response of “Hi! Yay,I have a new friend!”




One main section in NLP is word embedding.

Word embedding is commonly seen in NLP to represent certain words. 
Using word embedding, the vector of each word is adjusted to be able to predict what to say.
